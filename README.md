## üöÄ Description

The **Movies Catalog** was developed to participate of Woovi Challenge and has the objective to make movies catalogation by name and genre.

## üìÑ Getting Started

To make the setup you first need to clone this repository typing the comand below in your terminal:

    https://github.com/dchueri/woovi-challenge.git

Next, you need to access the project path: 

    cd server

If you'd like to use Docker (recomended) just insert the comand below:

    docker compose up --build
    
Or access the *server* path and install the application:

    cd server
    npm install    


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

* `TypeScript`
* `GraphQL` - First time using GraphQL, I thougth very interesting to learn a new paradigm to construct this API, since I started in development I have always practice API-REST and OO;
* `KoaJS` - Used for web server;
* `Mongoose` - ODM. 
* `MongoDB` - Database used; and
* `Docker` - Was a docker-compose file to execute the API in containers (more stable).
